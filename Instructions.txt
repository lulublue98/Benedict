INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING BENEDICT

Gameplay:

1. To play a game, enter "game" at the start of the program. 

2. Benedict will tell you if your entries are invalid during the game. 

3. To exit the game, you must either play through to the end, or kill the program with the Terminal command ^C.

4. Also, during a game, you must use the ^C to end the program overall.



Conversation:

1. There are a number of built in responses in Benedict's system. For instance, Benedict will always answer "hello" with "Hello". Also, if you enter something that he cannot interpret, he will answer "I don't understand".

2. To start a conversation, enter "let's have a conversation" at the start of the program.

3. When Benedict asks "Okay, what do you want to talk about?", give him a noun, verb, or adjective as a topic of conversation. 

4. To exit talking mode, enter "done". Then, you can start a game by entering "game", or start a new conversation.

5. You can end the program at any time during conversation. To do so, enter "goodbye". Only in game mode is the kill command necessary.

6. Benedict's interpretation system is not case sensitive, so as long as you follow the syntax rules, Benedict will understand you.
